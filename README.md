## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I try to follow coding standards and best practices, such as using meaningful variable names, writing modular code, and adding comments where necessary. This makes it easier to debug and maintain the code over time. I also conduct testing. I test individual components or functions to ensure they work as expected. 

I also try to implement best security practices. Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, multi-factor authentication) and ensure proper role-based access control. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I try and gather all needs and expectations for the project. 

## How do I approach designing software?
I clearly work to understand the problem and define the goal at hand. I then break the system into smaller bit-sized pieces to make things more achievable. I also ensure the system can handle growth in users or data.
